 A labyrinth symbolizes  possible  difficulties  reaching  web  project goals. Knowledge and experience with web technology disciplines  may be helpful. 

Some times companies are not interested in how their web sites are constructed, as long as they have the features and functionality needed to satisfy their target market. The cost of updating, maintaining, and deploying web sites may cost a magnitude  more money than to create them.
