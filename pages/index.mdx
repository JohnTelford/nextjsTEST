## JohnTelford.com LLC

JohnTelford.com.LLC is a web technology consulting company working with client  web development projects.

Building web sites is not easy. Web programming is complex, time consuming, and  expensive. Optimized Web development and deployment environments are critical.

This site discusses leveraging component web  technologies and software engineering practices to optimize creating, updating, maintaining, and deploying web sites, to reduce overall costs.

I am an Electronics and Software Engineer specializing in web hardware and software technology disciplines:

- Architecture
- Development
- Deployment

A labyrinth symbolizes  possible  difficulties  reaching  web  project goals. Knowledge and experience with web technology disciplines  may be helpful.

Business focus, marketing messages, customer needs, and other factors usually  require  web site updates.

Some times companies are not interested in how their web sites are constructed, as long as they have the features and functionality needed to satisfy their target market. The cost of not being interested may cost a magnitude  more to update and maintain the web site than to developing it.
