## Web Development Stack

---

Web site development is not easy. It is difficult, time consuming, and expensive. Optimizing the web development environment is critical.

Developing web software using local development workstations and software is advantageous. The development environment is not locked into cloud vendor services. It can be updated with new and improved hardware and software quicker than relying on cloud vendor service to update

## Overview

<Image src="/webdevstack.png" height={600} width={400}  />

_This overview diagram depicts the web development stack used to build and deploy this web site_

### Brief Synopsis

- VSvode text editor is used to create, edit, and store web site source files in the Local GitHub Repository.

- [Nextra](https://nextra.vercel.app) is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) based static site generator. It reads source files from the Local GitHub Repository and creates a live preview local Development web site. Any source file edits updates the live preview.

- Git commits the Local GitHub Repository file changes to the remote GitHub Repository.

- Next.js builds a web site image ready to deploy to the Internet.

- Netlify deploys the web site image to the Internet

## Web Development Stack

The web development stack uses local and web-based services to create, deploy, and manage web sites. It abstracts other technologies, help making developing web sites faster, more robust, and cost less.

Versions of edited web project files are stored locally and in a remote repository. The web site is deployed to the Internet using vendor cloud-based web services, eliminating the need for local web services.

User web browsers render web pages by interrupting web standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript instructions generated using the web development stack.

### Visual Studio Code

Developers using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as Central Command and Control enables developing, managing, and deploying web sites. `VScode`, is a lightweight open source code editor that runs on local development computers, and is available for Linux, macOS, and Windows. It may be the best text editor in years

There are a wealth of [extensions Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com) to customize `VScode` look and feel. Several color themes, programming language specific intelligence code completion, snippets, color coding, error checking, spelling, and many more are available.

### Text Editor

### Command Shell

### Git command

### VScode

`Vscode` is the command and control framework for building web component web site. Development time is spent editing and managing source code files.

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a key development stack source control component. It is built-in to `VScode`.

The `VScode` `MDX` Extension dramatically speeds up development. Some `MDX` features are:

- Syntax highlighting quickly detects errors while typing or building, and may give hints about problems

- Frequent snippets of code can be quickly inserted

- Section builder provides a quick way for setting section header levels

- Live preview compiles source code being edited showing how the file will be displayed on the web

### Command Shell

## Distributed Version Control System

### Git

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) source control is built-in to `VScode`.

`Git` is a key development stack component. It is a distributed version control system designed to track project file changes. Its attributes are using a local file repository, speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows and keeping track of file changes among multiple developers. `Git`is responsible for everything `GitHub`-related that happens on local development computers. The developer pushes changes stored in the local file repository to `GitHub` for safe keeping and sharing with other project developers.

### GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is an online web hosted repository for `git` projects. It is a platform for hosting versions of project files in a remote repository that is a unified source of truth. It helps software teams collaborate and maintain the entire history of projects file changes. Developers can view history of changes and go back to a previous version. It helps answer the questions _who changed what, where, when, and why?_

A local copy of the project `GitHub` repository is stored on development computers. `Git` is responsible for everything `GitHub`-related on local development computers. `Git` is used to locally stage edited project files. Developers are required to write a _why_ message before committing changes to the `GitHub` project repository.

## Next.js

> [Next.js](https://www.Next.jsjs.com/) is the best way to create static websites with React. It lets you use React components, but outputs pre-rendered [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) and [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) to guarantee the fastest load time. ...React

Next.js is a web site generator based on abstracting React and Node component frameworks creating fast websites.

Next.js plugin components and React components are chosen for building a web app structure, and then are welded together with JSX and MDX.

The Next.js `build` command produces a directory of static web standard [HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML), and [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) files that is deployed to a vendor cloud-based web services.

## Netlify

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is a popular Application Delivery Network (ADN). It provides continuous web deployment. When `Netlify` is notified of a commit initiated by `VScode` to a shared `GitHub` repository, or by the `Netlify CLI` command program running on development computers, `Netlify` builds the web site and deploys it worldwide to every major cloud provider. Developers instruct `Netlify` to deploy previews of the web site enabling stake holders to view the state of the project on a preview web site, before deploying to the production web site.
